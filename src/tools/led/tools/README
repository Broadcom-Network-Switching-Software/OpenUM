This directory contains tools for programming the LED processor.
Contained herein are:

    ledasm.h --
	A common include file used by ledasm.c

    ledasm.c --
	A simple assembler that converts a .asm into .lst and .hex files.

In order to build these tools, edit the Makefile and set CC, RM, CFLAGS,
etc. to the correct C compiler for your system.  No special libraries or
includes are required.

A example to build assembler and generate LED uCode (*.hex) for BCM953406 platform.

    a. Enter directory $UM/tools/led/tools
        'cd $UM/tools/led/tools'

    b. Copy file 'gh_mixed_embedded_1.asm' from example directory
        'cp ../example/gh_mixed_embedded_1.asm .'

    c. Generate an assembler 'ledasm' that can convert the .asm file into .hex file.
        'make' or 'make all' or 'make ledasm¡¦

    d. Use assembler to covert the .asm file into .hex file.
        'ledasm gh_mixed_embedded_1'
